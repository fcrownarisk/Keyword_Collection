explicit: Declares an explicit type conversion operator.

extern: Declares an externally implemented method.

false: The false value of the Boolean type.

finally: Exception handling; a code block that executes regardless of whether an exception occurs.

fixed: Prevents the garbage collector from relocating a variable; used in unsafe code.

float: Single-precision floating-point type.

for: Loop statement.

foreach: Iterates through each element in a collection.

goto: Unconditional jump statement.

if: Conditional statement.

implicit: Declares an implicit type conversion operator.

in: Used for contravariance in generic interfaces and delegates, or in foreach loops.

int: Integer type.

interface: Declares an interface.

internal: Declares internal access; accessible only within the current assembly.

is: Checks if an object is compatible with a given type.

lock: Ensures a code block is not executed by multiple threads simultaneously.

long: Long integer type.

namespace: Declares a namespace.

new: Creates an object instance or hides a base class member.

null: Null reference.

object: The base type of all types.

operator: Overloads an operator.

out: Used as a parameter modifier to indicate an output parameter, or for covariance in generic interfaces and delegates.

override: Overrides a virtual or abstract method of the base class.

params: Allows a method to accept a variable number of arguments.

private: Declares private access.

protected: Declares protected access.

public: Declares public access.

readonly: Declares a read-only field.

ref: Used as a parameter modifier to indicate pass-by-reference.

return: Returns from a function.

sbyte: 8-bit signed integer.

sealed: Prevents a class from being inherited or a method from being overridden.

short: Short integer type.

sizeof: Gets the size of a value type in bytes.

stackalloc: Allocates memory on the stack in unsafe code.

static: Declares a static member.

string: String type.

switch: Multi-way selection statement.

this: Refers to the current object.

throw: Throws an exception.

true: The true value of the Boolean type.

try: Exception handling; attempts to execute a code block that may throw an exception.

typeof: Gets the System.Type object for a type.

uint: Unsigned integer type.

ulong: Unsigned long integer type.

unchecked: Does not check for arithmetic overflow.

using: Introduces a namespace or defines a resource scope (ensures resource disposal).

virtual: Declares a virtual method.

void: Specifies that a method does not return a value.

volatile: Specifies that a field may be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously; prohibits optimization.

while: Loop statement.
