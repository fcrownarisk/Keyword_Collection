| `With...End With` | Allows multiple property or method calls on the same object without re-specifying it . |
| `Exit` | Exits a loop or procedure prematurely (e.g., `Exit For`, `Exit Sub`) . |

| `Option Explicit` | When `On`, requires explicit declaration of all variables (default is `On`). |

- Keywords like `Overloads`, `Overrides`, and `Shadows` provide fine-grained control over member behavior in inheritance hierarchies .
- **Type conversion** is a rich area in VB.NET, with functions like `CType`, `DirectCast`, and `TryCast` offering different performance and safety trade-offs .
- VB.NET code is compiled to **Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL)** and runs on the **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**, enabling cross-language integration and platform independence (within .NET) .
